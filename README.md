          As our society stepped into a stage where aged people have a bigger population than others, the annual population growth rate started to decrease and eventually turned into a negative number.
          This will result in a situation where most countries' populations will decrease after reaching a certain number. This circumstance raised a question, <strong>"Which country will have the largest population in the future?"</strong>

          Based on the Bar Chart and the Line plot, there is no doubt that China has been the country with the biggest population for decades.
          We can see how China's population grew through the Line Plot. In 1949, China first published an "Encourage Fertility" policy that massively stimulated population growth.
          Within 30 years, China's population has exceeded a thousand million. Until then, the Chinese government realized the urgent of birth control to benefit its economy.
          Thus, in 1982, it released the "Family planning" policy that restricted each family to only have one child, which effectively reduced China's population growth rate continuously.
          But, the consequence is, In 2020, most children who were raised during the birth-controlled policy period started to form a family. Even the Chinese government had yielded the birth-control policy in 2020.
          The population growth rate continued to drop. According to the line chart, the Chinese population will start to decrease around 2030, and India will then become the country with the largest population, and it will last for a long time.

          Surprisingly, Nigeria's population will pass the 400 million mark and maintain its growth rate till 2100. Until then, most developed countries
          will have an aging society and a decreasing population growth rate, including India, which might be an opportunity for Nigeria to have the largest population in the far future.

          Many factors could influence the population growth rate. For instance, in the history of China's growing population, Policies and economy 
          all stimulate the fertility rate. But at the same time, they could also become the factor that reduces the growth rate. On the other hand,
          Nigeria is benefiting from the growth of its population since it is still a developing country that needs people for infrastructure,
          just like what China did in the past. Therefore, as Nigeria reaches a point where its population no longer brings advantages to the country,
          its growth rate will also slow down and replicateChina's current circumstance. It's hard to predict which country will have the largest population next.
          Still, there is no doubt countries that are benefited from the population will continue to encourage fertility, which might create a second "China" decades later.
